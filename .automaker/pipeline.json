YOU MUST WRITE AND ADD TESTS TO THE CODEBASE.**\n\nThis step requires you to:\n1. **REVIEW** what needs testing\n2. **UPDATE** the codebase by writing and adding test files\n\n**You cannot complete this step by only identifying what needs testing. You MUST create test files and write tests.**\n\n---\n\n### Phase 1: Review Phase\nIdentify what needs test coverage:\n\n- Review new functions, methods, and classes\n- Identify new API endpoints\n- Check for edge cases that need testing\n- Identify integration points that need testing\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2: Update Phase - ⚠️ MANDATORY ACTION REQUIRED ⚠️\n\n**YOU MUST NOW WRITE AND ADD TESTS TO THE CODEBASE.**\n\n**This is not optional. You must create test files and write actual test code.**\n\n#### Action Steps (You MUST complete these):\n\n1. **Write Unit Tests** - CREATE TEST FILES:\n   - ✅ Write unit tests for all new functions and methods\n   - ✅ Ensure edge cases are covered\n   - ✅ Test error handling paths\n   - ✅ Aim for high code coverage on new code\n   - ✅ **CREATE TEST FILES AND WRITE THE ACTUAL TEST CODE**\n\n2. **Write Pest Browser Tests** - CREATE TEST FILES:\n   - ✅ Test interactions between components/modules\n   - ✅ You can use Laravel features like `Event::fake()`, `assertAuthenticated()`, and model factories within Pest 4 browser tests, as well as `RefreshDatabase` (when needed) to ensure a clean state for each test.\n   - ✅ Take screenshots or pause tests for debugging when appropriate.\n   - ✅ Verify API endpoints work correctly if applicable\n   - ✅ Test database operations if applicable\n   - ✅ **CREATE INTEGRATION TEST FILES AND WRITE THE ACTUAL TEST CODE**\n\n3. **Ensure Test Quality** - WRITE QUALITY TESTS:\n   - ✅ Tests should be readable and well-documented\n   - ✅ Each test should have a clear purpose\n   - ✅ Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario\n   - ✅ Browser tests should live in `tests/Browser/`.\n   - ✅ Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern\n   - ✅ **WRITE COMPLETE, FUNCTIONAL TESTS**\n\n4. **Run Tests** - VERIFY TESTS WORK:\n   - ✅ Run the full test suite and ensure all new tests pass\n   - ✅ Verify no existing tests are broken\n   - ✅ Check that test coverage meets project standards\n   - ✅ **FIX ANY FAILING TESTS**\n\n---\n\n### Summary Required\nAfter completing BOTH review AND update phases, provide:\n- A summary of testing needs identified\n- **A detailed list of ALL test files created and tests written (this proves you updated the codebase)**\n- Test coverage metrics achieved\n- Any issues found during testing and how they were resolved\n\n---\n\n# ⚠️ FINAL REMINDER ⚠️\n\n**Identifying what needs testing without writing tests is INCOMPLETE and UNACCEPTABLE.**\n\n**You MUST create test files and write actual test code.**\n**You MUST show evidence of test files created in your summary.**\n**This step is only complete when tests have been written and added to the codebase.**",
